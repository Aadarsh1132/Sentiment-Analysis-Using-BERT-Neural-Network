# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-BERT-Neural-Network
 Created a project of Machine Learning based on Sentiment Analysis Using BERT Neural Network
 Here we have used "Transformers" , "Pytorch", "BeautifulSoup" library
 Transformers library is commonly used for working with transformer-based models, including BERT, GPT, and others. 
 In transformers library there is a class "AutoTokenizer" which is responsible for tokenizing input text, converting it into numerical input that can be fed into the neural network. 
 Also in Transformer library there is class "AutoModelForSequenceClassification"  which is used to load a pre-trained transformer model for sequence classification tasks. The model is fine-tuned to classify sequences of text into predefined categories.
 After training the model using transformer we used web scrapping to extract data from the webpage.
 BeautifulSoup was used for web scrapping the data
 Then this data is used to test the model performance.
