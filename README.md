# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-BERT-Neural-Network
 We'll go through how to get up and running with Hugging Face Transformers and BERT to be able to calculate sentiment. We'll run the model using a single prompt but also leverage BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews from Yelp to be able to calculate sentiment on a larger scale. 

Transformers allows you to easily leverage a pre-trained BERT neural network.

We'll learn how to: 
1. Install Transformers
2. Perform Sentiment Scoring using BERT and Python
3. Scrape reviews from Yelp and Calculate their Sentiment
